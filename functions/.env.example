# Firebase Functions Environment Variables
# 
# IMPORTANT: This file should NOT be committed to git
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values
#
# For Firebase Functions deployment, set your backend URL here
# CRITICAL: Backend URL must be publicly accessible when functions are deployed
#           Firebase Functions in cloud CANNOT access localhost!

# Backend API URL
# For production: Use your deployed backend URL
BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-url.com

# For testing with ngrok:
# 1. Start backend: cd backend && npm start
# 2. Start ngrok: ngrok http 3001
# 3. Copy the https URL from ngrok (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io)
# 4. Set it here:
# BACKEND_URL=https://abc123.ngrok.io

# For local development with Firebase Emulator:
# Functions run locally, so they CAN access localhost
# BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
# Then run: firebase emulators:start --only functions,firestore
